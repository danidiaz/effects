Module      : Data.Open.Union
Description : Open unions (type-indexed co-products) for extensible effects.
Copyright   : Alej Cabrera 2015

Maintainer  : cpp.cabrera@gmail.com
Stability   : experimental
Portability : POSIX

All operations are constant-time, and there is no Typeable constraint

This is a variation of OpenUion5.hs, which relies on overlapping
instances instead of closed type families. Closed type families
have their problems: overlapping instances can resolve even
for unground types, but closed type families are subject to a
strict apartness condition.

This implementation is very similar to OpenUnion1.hs, but without
the annoying Typeable constraint. We sort of emulate it:

Our list r of open union components is a small Universe.
Therefore, we can use the Typeable-like evidence in that
universe.

The data constructors of Union are not exported.
